# Oracle & Blockchain Configuration
# The private key of the wallet that will act as the Oracle.
# IMPORTANT: When running with the local Hardhat node, you can copy a private key from one of the test accounts it provides.
# For production, this key must be managed securely (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) and have sufficient funds for gas fees.

# --- Contract Addresses ---
# These addresses are automatically generated when you run the deploy script (`npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js`).
# The script saves them in a file (`backend/contracts/contract-addresses.json`), and the oracle loads them.
# You do not need to set these manually for local development.
# For production, you will need to deploy the contracts and place their addresses here.
